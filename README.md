# Project to user docker to deploy a Blazor server application with a local database

This was to test out an idea I had to try to provide cheap and easy authenication to my simple Blazor applications.

*** PLEASE NOTE THIS REQUIRES .NET 6, Visual Studio 2022 and Docker ***

## Why

Just looking for a cheap replacement for all my authenications for my applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorDockerAuthenication
   cd BlazorDockerAuthenication
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. Blazor Server side with basic authenication
2. Docker build and deployment


## Worth Noting
Even though this project did not work as I had hoped, it was an ecellent learning opportunity Images were used to instead of icons for a change of pace.
